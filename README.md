# bufferoverflowtoolkit

# Credits:
I took a large portion of the script from TheCyberMentor's buffer overflow videos and modified them for Python3. I used some ideas from the TryHackMe buffer overflow room instructions and made some quality of life improvements of my own.

Used for creating buffer overflow exploits.
Requires Python3
